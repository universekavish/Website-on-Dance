                    <p class="p2">Dance is a type of Meditation.......</p>
                    <p class="p2">Dancing is such a huge, and happy part of life, and it also offers so many benefits, such as greatly improving your health and fitness and even boosting your mood. So, letâ€™s not forget how much fun you can have when you get up and get moving on the dance floor.</p>
                    <p class="p2">There are plenty of reasons to start dancing, such as fitness, overall health, mood improvement, the ability to dance with friends and family members at special events or even just to show off at a hot new club in town. Also, there are so many different styles that you can learn as well, to always keep your dancing fresh and fun. Here at Arthur Murray Dance Studio, we want you to be inspired to join us on the dance floor, but before you do that, we wanted to share with you some factors to consider, so be sure to continue reading to gain some knowledge:</p>            
                    <p class="p2"><br>1.<u>Physical condition</u>: With so many different paces of music, it is obvious that there are just as many dance styles to match. For example, classical music is best complemented by a slower paced dance, such as the Waltz, whereas faster paced music would fit best with a faster paced dance, such as the Salsa. Even if you do not have the best physical condition, the Waltz is probably still a safe bet, but if you would rather try the ever spicy Salsa, you will want to make sure that your physical capabilities are comfortable for the moves associated with this dance. Assess what your body is capable of doing before jumping into any dancing, but know that there is always a style that will best fit your needs.</br>
                        <br>2.<u>Dancing taste</u>: Your physical capabilities will not be the only large deciding factor for your dancing, as you have your own taste in music and probably want to be able to dance to the music that you enjoy listening to. If you happen to be more of a shy person and would rather not steal the show with your dancing, it may be best not to start with dances that do not focus on a single dancer, but rather as a group. You and your friends will be able to enjoy a group dance that includes everyone, or you can gather some one-on-one time, whichever your taste prefers.</br>
                        <br>3.<u>Dancing goals</u>: There could be a myriad of reasons as to why you would want to get involved with dance. You could be interested in meeting new friends, getting yourself out of the house for a fun and healthy activity, boosting your self-confidence or mood or even want to use dancing as a way to get into shape. No matter what your reason is, it is always a good idea to learn how to dance. As soon as you figure out what you want to gain from dancing, you can set goals and achievements for yourself.</br>
                    </p>            
                    <p class="p2">If you are wanting to start dancing, carefully consider these factors before you dive in, allowing you the opportunity to find the right style and fit for your need and interests. Here at Arthur Murray Dance Studio, we provide an array of lessons and classes, so you will surely be able to find a perfect fit for your style. So, be sure to contact us today to begin your California dancing.</p>
